# BachelorThesisOTH2024
 
To finish my studies at OTH Amberg-Weiden, I am writing a bachelor's thesis "Functions-on-demand in modern cars". As I wanted to improve my knowledge of Python, I decided to use it for data analysis instead of MS Excel or SPSS. This public repository is mainly for other students, which would like to use similar methods to analyze data from a survey.

Any comment is welcome. I am aware that the code is not perfect, however it gets the job done and will improve upon need. The "if 0" will be changed:D
